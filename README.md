# PowerShell-TestCreds
Test a CSV of breached plain-text credentials against Active Directory to determine if they are valid.

Add the breached username and password pair to the CSV template and execute the Powershell script. You will need to point the script to the CSV with the credentials and specify where you would like to save the results.
